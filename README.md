# Algorithms
'Textbook' implementation of many fundamental algorithms and datastructures in Go.

These implementations are for educational purposes only, most of these algorithms have better implementations elsewhere.

These were primarily written while studing for an exam so most are not as beautiful or well documented as I'd wish.

### TODO
- Improve documentation to make this a more usefull educational resource.
- Further implement linked list.
- Add more algorithms and datastructures (eg. Tries).
- Improve hash table implementation.
- Extend red black trees implementation
