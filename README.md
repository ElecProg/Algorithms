# Algorithms
'Textbook' implementation of many fundamental algorithms and datastructures in Go.

These implementations are for educational purposes only, most of these algorithms have better implementations elsewhere.

### TODO
- Improve documentation to make this a more usefull educational resource.
- Further implement linked list.
- Add more algorithms and datastructures (eg. Tries).
- Improve hash table implementation
